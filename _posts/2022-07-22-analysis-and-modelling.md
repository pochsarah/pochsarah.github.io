##### Abstract 

<p>The development of advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques offers many possibilities but requires a lot of computing resources. In these conditions, is it really necessary to use such techniques to perform simple tasks such as counting objects? Template Matching, a rather old computer vision technique, can be used to perform this task in a simple and resource efficient way.
Another advantage of using such a technique is to couple it with other types of analysis such as OBIA to improve  the results. Indeed, one of the limitations of template matching in terms of accuracy can be reduced thanks to this.</p>
