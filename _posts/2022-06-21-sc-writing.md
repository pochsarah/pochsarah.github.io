**Abstract**

With more data and more advanced technologies and more free access to spatial images, gathering information in wartime is only made easier. Also, if in situ data are still relevant and usefull, using spatial technologies is a good alternative. It allows autorities and organisations to collect data that are unavailable throught this ground sensors. In war times, the urgent need of information, the destruction of infrastructures among others make spatial data essential. This article will give a non-exhaustive overview of how spatial technologies matter.
